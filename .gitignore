# Let's reduce this very long list that have been created by people that think that I or somebody else will ever need any files genereated by IntelliJ in a public repository as they are very IDE specific and when I would like to build this project on another machine that would definetely have an IntelliJ installed and activated I would thank them for including some IDE specific stuff.
# The short answer is NO. I would never want them unless being under some very specific conditions, that is definetely not the case here.
